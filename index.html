<h2>Reluctant ball player</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
In this game, you need to corrale the NPC into the baseballs being thrown in his general vicinity.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Try to indirectly control an NPC which will force you to try to navigate around the character in order to get him to go where you want.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
You have to put the NPC in position to catch the baseballs being tossed in his general direction.  The character is repelled by your own character, so you have to try to run around him to get him into position, and you have to try to plan a path to allow you to get the NPC to catch multiple balls in the air at the same time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
I wanted to create an AI that reacts to the player's movements
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Your kid isn't really interested in playing baseball, nor and he doesn't seem to want your presense at the moment.  So you have to manipulate him into playing the game by chasing him around into the baseballs thrown across the field so he will catch them.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People looking to kill time with a simple game that they can rack up high scores with practice.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
One round of gameplay lasts two minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The player will need to know when to give up on a ball and go after others.
</li>
